#WebGL Experiments
This is a repo of my little games with WebGL & an iPad. Note that this is not stable **at all**, and that to use and iPad as a display or in standalone requires WebGL to be working on it, and at the time of writing (iOS5) the only way to achieve this is through hacks. See [here](http://demoseen.com/webglenabler/) and [here](https://github.com/gauthiier/GoWebGL).

The code came from various sources (and frankly needs a rewrite), so if you want recognition feel free to contact me.
